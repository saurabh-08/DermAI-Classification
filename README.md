## DermoscopySimCLR**

DermoscopySimCLR is a deep learning project focused on the classification of skin lesions using dermoscopy images. This repository utilizes the SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) model for feature extraction and classification of benign and malignant skin lesions. The project aims to leverage advanced techniques in data augmentation, contrastive learning, and transfer learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of skin lesion classification.

**Dataset**
This project uses the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, which contains a diverse set of dermoscopy images for the classification of skin lesions. The dataset can be downloaded here: https://api.isic-archive.com/collections/70/
